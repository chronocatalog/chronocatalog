"""The verify command: recompute every name and report what disagrees.

For each group, the master's capture time and content hash are
recomputed and the resulting prefix compared with the one on disk.
The classification distinguishes what a mismatch *means*:

- a date difference is a naming error (or a deliberate re-date),
- a hash difference on a format that is edited in place is expected drift,
- a hash difference on an immutable format is a corruption alarm.

Groups whose master is structurally ambiguous (a RAW plus a conversion
named after it) are settled by evidence: the candidate whose content hash
matches the prefix is the master, the others are treated as derivatives.
