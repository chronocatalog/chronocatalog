"""The organize command: triage a messy tree, touch absolutely nothing.

Old dumps accumulate files no automated rule should rename: photos with
stripped metadata, duplicates of duplicates, exports with fabricated
dates. organize runs the import planning pipeline over such a tree and
produces a report designed for working through it by hand:

- what each recognizable group *would* be named and where it would live,
- which files are already in the archive (byte-identical) or clash with
  it,
- which masters could only be dated from the file's modification time —
  proposed, but flagged: mtime is hearsay, not evidence,
- which groups share identical content with each other (duplicate
  clusters),
- what remains unresolvable.

There is no ``--apply``. When a batch looks right, import it with the
import command; organize itself never moves anything.
