"""The import command: memory card to archive, named on arrival.

Files on the card are grouped by original base name (master plus its
sidecars and labeled derivatives), the master's capture time and content
hash produce the family's prefix, and every member is **copied** into
the tree's layout directory under its canonical name. Sources on the
card are never modified or deleted — the card remains the last-resort
backup until it is formatted in the camera.

After copying, every master is re-hashed at its destination and compared
against the digest computed from the card, so a transfer error cannot go
unnoticed. Groups that cannot be imported safely (unresolvable capture
time, target already present, no recognizable master) are reported and
skipped; they never abort the rest of the card.
