"""Naming digests: the right hash for each master, per the pattern.

The pattern decides per extension whether a master's naming digest
covers the whole file or the image data only (see
:class:`chronocatalog.pattern.NamingPattern`). This module computes either
kind, backed by the per-machine manifest so unchanged files are never
re-read: whole-file digests via parallel local hashing, image-data
digests via ExifTool. Manifest entries for image digests use the
``<algorithm>-image`` key, so the two kinds can never be confused.
