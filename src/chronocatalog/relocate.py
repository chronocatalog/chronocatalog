"""The relocate command: put named files where their names say they belong.

A tree's layout maps each capture time to a directory, and the capture
time is in the name — so after a layout change (or a hand-move gone
wrong) the correct shelf for every named group is derivable, and
relocate moves whole groups there through the same validated,
write-ahead-journaled apply as rename.

Two kinds of tree are never moved:

- **DAM-managed trees.** The DAM's catalog tracks files by path; moving
  them behind its back orphans the catalog entries. Relocate reports
  the misplacement and emits a folder checklist to execute *inside* the
  DAM (Lightroom Classic: drag in the Folders panel), where moves are
  catalog-safe. Explicitly targeting a DAM-managed tree with ``apply``
  is an error, never a partial run.
- **``{shoot}`` segments.** A shoot is chosen at import and recorded
  nowhere else, so a shoot directory can never be derived back from a
  name. Groups misplaced *around* the shoot segment (say, the wrong
  year) are reported, not moved.
