"""Grouping files into groups that are renamed as one unit.

Two grouping regimes exist:

- **Named files** group by their name prefix. Prefixes embed a content
  hash, so they are unique per master across the whole archive — sidecars
  kept in subdirectories (``NKSC_PARAM/<master>.nksc``) fall into their
  master's group with no directory logic at all.

- **Card originals** (files not yet named) group by directory and original
  base name: ``DSC1234.NEF``, ``DSC1234.xmp`` and ``DSC1234.NEF.xmp``
  share the base ``DSC1234``. Sidecar-directory rules map files like
  ``NKSC_PARAM/DSC1234.NEF.nksc`` to the master's directory first. A group
  whose base extends another group's base with a ``-`` or ``_`` label
  (``DSC1234-Edit``) is merged into that group only when the shorter base
  owns a master and the labeled group does not — a labeled group with its
  own master file is a separate photo, not a derivative, so ``IMG_01.NEF``
  never merges into ``IMG.NEF``. Callers should pass camera-native master
  extensions here (not ``tif``), so editor output like ``…-Edit.tif``
  counts as a derivative rather than a master.
