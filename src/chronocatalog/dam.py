"""DAM token injection: let the DAM rename the masters it manages.

A DAM (e.g. Adobe Lightroom Classic) must rename its own masters or its
catalog loses track of them — but it cannot compute content hashes. The
bridge is a metadata token: chronocatalog writes each master's computed
name into a field the DAM exposes as a filename template token (for
Lightroom Classic, IPTC "Job Identifier" — `TransmissionReference`),
and the DAM renames from that token.

Where the token goes follows where the DAM keeps metadata:

- a RAW master with an ``.xmp`` sidecar → the sidecar,
- an embedded-metadata master (JPEG, DNG, TIFF, PSD) → the file itself
  (its content hash goes stale at that moment, which is expected for
  formats that are edited in place),
- a RAW master **without** a sidecar → reported as ``needs-sidecar``.
  chronocatalog never fabricates a sidecar: the DAM reading a minimal,
  script-made file could wipe catalog-side metadata. Save metadata from
  the DAM first, then rerun.

The DAM workflow after injection (Lightroom Classic):

1. Metadata → Read Metadata from Files on the affected folders,
2. Library → Rename Photos with the single ``{Job Identifier}`` token.
