"""Write-ahead journal for renames.

Before anything on disk changes, the complete plan is written to a
journal file outside the archive. As each family completes, its key is
appended to a companion done-log — an append is cheap and crash-safe,
so a run interrupted at any point can be resumed (already-done families
are skipped) or undone (done families are reverted in reverse order).

Journals live in ``~/.chronocatalog/journals`` by default, never inside
the archive: a tool must not mix its own records into the tree it is
renaming.
