"""Write-ahead journal for renames and copies.

Before anything on disk changes, the complete plan is written to a
journal file outside the archive. As each family completes, its key is
appended to a companion done-log — an append is cheap and crash-safe,
so a run interrupted at any point can be resumed (already-done families
are skipped) or undone (done families are reverted in reverse order).
Undoing appends a tombstone line rather than rewriting the log, so the
log itself can never be truncated by a crash.

Copy journals record each copy's expected digest, so undo can verify a
destination file still is the copy this run made before deleting it.

Journals live in ``~/.chronocatalog/journals`` by default, never inside
the archive: a tool must not mix its own records into the tree it is
renaming.
