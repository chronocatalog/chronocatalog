"""Capture-time resolution from metadata tags.

A file's capture time is resolved by trying an ordered chain of tag names
against the group-qualified metadata ExifTool returned. The first entry
that yields a complete, plausible timestamp wins. A file for which no
entry matches is *unresolved* — reported, never guessed at, and never
given a partial date.

Chain entries come in two forms:

- ``Group:Tag`` matches exactly that group.
- ``Tag`` matches the tag in any group, *except* groups that some entry
  of the chain names explicitly for the same tag. This encodes rankings
  such as "any CreateDate, but QuickTime's only as a last resort": list
  ``CreateDate`` first and ``QuickTime:CreateDate`` later. QuickTime
  timestamps are usually UTC while maker-notes ones are local wall-clock,
  so the local source must win when both are present.

An entry suffixed ``@utc`` (e.g. ``QuickTime:CreateDate@utc``) declares
that the tag stores UTC: its value is converted, DST-aware, into the
configured timezone, and the resolution's source carries the marker so
reports always show that a conversion happened. Do not mark sources
that store local time (BRAW's QuickTime atoms do).

All resolved values are naive local wall-clock time, as a person at the
scene would have read off a watch. Timezone suffixes in metadata values
are deliberately ignored; the wall-clock part is the identity.
