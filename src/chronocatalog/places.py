"""Where a named file belongs: tree layouts applied to name-derived dates.

The canonical name carries the capture time, and a tree's layout maps a
capture time to a directory — so the correct shelf for every named file
is derivable from the name alone. The one exception is the ``{shoot}``
token: a shoot is chosen at import and recorded nowhere else, so a
shoot segment matches any directory name and can never be derived back.
