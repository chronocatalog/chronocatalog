"""Content hashing: streamed, parallel, several digests per read.

Hashing is CPU-bound and is the throughput bottleneck on fast storage, so
files are hashed in parallel worker processes. When more than one digest
of a file is needed (verifying an old hash while computing a new one
during a pattern migration), all of them are fed from a single read pass —
the file is never read twice.
