"""The rename command: bring names in line, directly, through the journal.

Renaming splits by who owns the file:

- In trees without DAM management, whole groups are renamed to their
  freshly derived prefix — master and every member, atomically.
- In DAM-managed trees, the master and its single-extension ``.xmp``
  belong to the DAM (see the inject command); rename touches only the
  members the DAM does not know: append-style sidecars
  (``prefix.nef.xmp``), sidecars in subdirectories, labeled derivatives.
  Both sides target the same derived prefix, so the order relative to
  the DAM's own rename does not matter.

A separate pass fixes malformed names that differ from a canonical name
only by extension case (``.FP2`` → ``.fp2``).

Everything flows through the write-ahead journal: validated as a whole,
applied per group with rollback, resumable, undoable.
